ABSTRACT = {Privacy and security are among the significant challenges of the Internet of Things (IoT). Improper device updates, lack of efficient and robust security protocols, user unawareness, and famous active device monitoring are among the challenges that IoT is facing. In this work, we are exploring the background of IoT systems and security measures, and identifying (a) different security and privacy issues, (b) approaches used to secure the components of IoT-based environments and systems, (c) existing security solutions, and (d) the best privacy models necessary and suitable for different layers of IoT driven applications. In this work, we proposed a new IoT layered model: generic and stretched with the privacy and security components and layers identification. The proposed cloud/edge supported IoT system is implemented and evaluated. The lower layer represented by the IoT nodes generated from the Amazon Web Service (AWS) as Virtual Machines. The middle layer (edge) implemented as a Raspberry Pi 4 hardware kit with support of the Greengrass Edge Environment in AWS. We used the cloud-enabled IoT environment in AWS to implement the top layer (the cloud). The security protocols and critical management sessions were between each of these layers to ensure the privacy of the users’ information. We implemented security certificates to allow data transfer between the layers of the proposed cloud/edge enabled IoT model. Not only is the proposed system model eliminating possible security vulnerabilities, but it also can be used along with the best security techniques to countermeasure the cybersecurity threats facing each one of the layers; cloud, edge, and IoT.},

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing both are developing technologies. Cloud Computing blows up to provide support to IoT by working as a sort of front-end and it is based on the concept of permitting users to do computing tasks using services delivered with internet. The cloud computing empower an appropriate, on-demand, and scalable network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources. The cloud-based IoT architecture includes features of cloud-based IoT platform and its interaction with three main cloud computing models: IaaS (infrastructure as a service), Paas (platform as a service), and SaaS (software as a service). The cloud and IoT integration empowers new scenarios, for smart services and applications, as Sensing as a Service (SaaS), DataBase as a Service (DBaaS), Video Surveillance as a Service (VSaaS), and many more. Various live company products, research projects, and projects with freely available source code in various areas of Cloud Computing and IoT integration are Nimbits, ThingSpeak, Paraimpu, Device Cloud, Sensor Cloud. REpresentational State Transfer (REST) architectural style web services and Constrained Application Protocol (COAP), Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), web transfer protocols are used for communication for the IoT resource-constrained things. Networking protocols like IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN) and IPv6 over Bluetooth Low Energy are used for constrained networks in IoT and cloud integration. The data link layer protocols for IoT devices like IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE 802.11ah, Z-Wave, WirelessHART, Bluetooth, Zigbee are used for short range communication for IoT things. The applications of integrated cloud and IoT include agriculture, video surveillance, healthcare, smart city, smart home and smart metering, etc. IoT and cloud integration involves several challenges and issues as standardization of machine to machine (M2M) communication and interoperability, power and energy efficiency of devices for data transmission and processing, big data generated by several devices, security and privacy, integration methodology, pricing and billing, network communications, storage, etc. In this chapter, the introduction of cloud and IoT, their integration architecture, integration applications, and challenges and issues involved are discussed.",

Cloud, being the crucial component of IoT, provides valuable application specific services in many application domains. A number of IoT cloud providers are currently emerging into the market to leverage suitable and specific IoT based services. In spite of huge possible involvement of these IoT clouds, no standard cum comparative analytical study has been found across the literature databases. This article surveys popular IoT cloud platforms in light of solving several service domains such as application development, device management, system management, heterogeneity management, data management, tools for analysis, deployment, monitoring, visualization, and research. A comparison is presented for overall dissemination of IoT clouds according to their applicability. Further, few challenges are also described that the researchers should take on in near future. Ultimately, the goal of this article is to provide detailed knowledge about the existing IoT cloud service providers and their pros and cons in concrete form.}

ABSTRACT = {Internet of Things (IoT) applications can play a critical role in business and industry. Industrial IoT (IIoT) refers to the use of IoT technologies in manufacturing. Enabling IIoT applications in cloud environments requires the design of appropriate IIoT Platform as-a-Service (IIoT PaaS) to support and ease their provisioning (i.e., development, deployment and management). This paper critically reviews the IIoT PaaS architectures proposed so far in the relevant literature. It only surveys the architectures that are suitable for IIoT applications provisioning and it excludes regular IoT solutions from its scope. The evaluation is based on a set of well-defined architectural requirements. It also introduces and discusses the future challenges and the research directions. The critical review discusses the PaaS solutions that focus on the whole spectrum of IoT verticals and also the ones dealing with specific IoT verticals. Existing limitations are identified and hints are provided on how to tackle them. As critical research directions, the mechanisms that enable the secure provisioning, and IIoT PaaS interaction with virtualized IoT Infrastructure as-a-Service (IaaS) and fog computing layer are discussed.},

abstract="In the modern world, the Internet of Things (IoT) has captured most of the applications in the market and it plays a significant role with various smart and interactive things that have provided a convenient environment for humans. Applications of IoT can be broadly classified based on consumer application, enterprise application, infrastructure management, industrial productivity, and so on. Some of the applications that implement the concepts of IoT are smart wearables, connected cars, industrial internet, precision agriculture, smart retail, energy management systems, and others. Advancement in IoT technology has resulted in automated home appliances and healthcare systems and also in the development of smart cities, smart homes, smart towns, and many more. For any application based on IoT, data are collected and are modeled using prediction analysis. The basic concept of using IoT is that it reduces waste, loss, and cost. The design of the IoT application should focus on increasing the energy efficiency and the cost efficiency of the system, improving safety, or creating better experiences. IoT is a field of the network, and it could be enabled either by wired or wireless communication networks. This refers to the technology where the machines could predict the data and work by itself. Here the devices that are connected to the private internet connection could communicate with others. The edge devices that are connected will create a huge amount of data. These data are generated at high speed, and also they face challenges like storage, computation, and networking. These issues can be handled by using cloud, edge, or cloud edge computing. This chapter focuses on the discussion of diverse applications in IoT because of its huge potential market, and also it enhances the comfort of our lives besides providing enhanced control of our daily and personal tasks with ease.",

abstract="In the upcoming year, the growth of IoT will tremendously increase. The factors like limited storage, low communication capability, less data storage, and limited computational power are associated with IoT devices. By the year 2025, almost 80 billion devices will be linked to IoT (Van 2017). Many issues arise when users and IoT devices continue to share computing and networking resources remotely. On the other hand, cloud computing supports massive storage capacity and high computing/processing capability. IoT devices produce a mass variety of data, these data need to be processed quickly and stored in high-capacity storage in a heterogeneous environment. Integrating IoT and Cloud Computing, the system becomes more powerful, robust, and intelligent, solving the user's problem more effectively and efficiently. In the pervasive and ubiquitous environment, there need to be more secure web services that can interact with IoT devices and sensors through cloud computing interactively. IoT-Cloud convergence has many challenges like security, data formatting, load balancing, energy consumption, etc. This paper analyses some of the issues mentioned above.",
